#summary The current status of this project.

= OpenFire Project Status =

The project is currently working towards it's first release, with the foundations 
for communication with the XFire server in place.

== Planned Release Dates ==

Release dates will largely follow the intended dates for the LAN party I attend, 
which is acting as the customer for this project. As such, expected release dates are:

|| *Release* || *Plannned Date*     ||
|| R1        || 12th July 2007      ||
|| R2        || 6th September 2007  ||
|| R3        || 14th December 2007  ||
|| R4        || 13th February 2008  ||
|| R5        || 10th April 2008     ||

Features for all these releases have not yet been planned - many requirements will
only be discovered once the first release have been completed and the customer
has had a chance to play with it.

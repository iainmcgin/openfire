#summary The current status of this project.

= OpenFire Project Status =
This project is in the early stages of development, but I expect to have a basic level of support for the XFire protocol by April 2007.

The requirements for this project are being driven by the LAN party I attend (http://www.gumpcom.com) and the intention is that stable releases of the software will emerge shortly before each LAN party, giving a schedule as follows:

|| *Release Number* || *Expected Date*||
|| v0.25            || 2007-02-08     ||
|| v0.5             || 2007-04-12     ||
|| v0.75            || 2007-06        ||
|| v1.0             || 2007-08        ||

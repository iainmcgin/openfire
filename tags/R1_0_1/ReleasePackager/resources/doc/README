OpenFire v1.0 (c) 2007 Absolute Zero Development
------------------------------------------------

OpenFire is a Java library and set of tools for communicating with users
via the XFire instant messaging network. It was written in order to produce
a set of tools to make managing large LAN parties easier - the first step
towards this goal is the OpenFire relay, which is included with this release.
It functions as a simple message bridge: a set of users specified in the
admins.list file are administrators and can broadcast to all friends of the
relay, and all the friends can send messages to the admins by sending messages
to the relay username. This has already proven useful for the LAN parties
I attend, in order to arrange tournaments when shouting won't work (the room
is too big, or everyone has their headphones on and is deeply engrossed in
their game).

This is the first official release of the OpenFire library, test client and 
relay. I am delighted to finally be able to make a public release, the code
in OpenFire to date seems quite stable and functional. If you use OpenFire
at one of your LAN parties, or use the library itself, drop me an email as
I'd love to hear about it. If you find any bugs, please either email me
or file an issue on the google code page.

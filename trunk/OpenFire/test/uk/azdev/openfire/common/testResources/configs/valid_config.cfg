### OPTIONAL BEGIN
### you may provide overriden values for the following, but the default
### values will work for the vast majority of installations. To force
### the values from their defaults, remove the # character before the property
### and edit to suit your needs.
#

## xfire version - this is the version number which will be reported to the xfire
## server. If the xfire server informs the client a new version number is available
## it will automatically reconnect with that number.
client.version=101

## xfire long version - this is sent in the initial chunk of data to the xfire server
## upon connecting. It does not seem to have changed in a significant amount of time.

server.host=xfire.azdev.co.uk
server.port=12345
